                <p>When asked to say a few words at your best friend’s wedding,<br>
                You have to watch what you say for it’s on thin ice you could be treading.<br>
                But one thing we did know is that it had to rhyme,<br>
                For Gillian has written us so many verses in her time.</p>

                <p>So let’s start at the beginning – April 1988,<br>
                Along came Gillian Irvine just 13 days late.<br>
                Winner of the bonny baby contest for the cutest kid in town<br>
                A Saintfield girl with little blonde curls – she was the <i>Star of the County Down.</i></p>

                <p>When Gillian &amp; I were little we were never far apart,<br>
                At primary school &amp; Girls’ Brigade or talking about boys in the park.<br>
                Then there was Sunday School, Duke of Ed &amp; working in the pub,<br>
                Or just sitting in Shirley’s drinking tea &amp; eating all her grub.</p>

                <p>The last few years we’ve had to travel further for the same,<br>
                Often involving buses, taxis, trains &amp; even planes.<br>
                Thankfully now we’ve seen the light &amp; both moved back to Belfast,<br>
                So Prosecco Fridays can be a regular thing at last.</p>

                <p>It didn’t seem to matter that I was late to join the scene<br>
                Starting my first job in the bar Gillian took me under her wing<br>
                Working with her here was a laugh but it’s not where our friendship grew<br>
                That only really happened when she joined the Down High crew.</p>

                <p>Being in different years was a pain &amp; so was being apart daily until noon<br>
                So we spent our days thinking of ways to sneak her into my common room.<br>
                &amp; although I met Gillian late on in my teens I feel like I’ve known her forever<br>
                She’s my ‘go to’ for advice, she’ll say what she thinks &amp; damn it she’s actually quite clever!</p>

                <p>She tried out being a waitress but, to be honest, she wasn’t great,<br>
                Oh yes, she had the charisma, but she could only ever carry one plate.<br>
                Those little hands were made for more delicate work it would seem,<br>
                Which is why London City bankers are walking around with teeth agleam.</p>

                <p>Aside from teeth, Gillian would be prone to a spot of cleaning,<br>
                In fact, Barry’s probably learned that there’s no point in intervening.<br>
                For when Gillian gets her marigolds on &amp; decides to do a clear out,<br>
                You’re better off heading to the garden, &amp; en route, getting a beer out.</p>

                <p>These days, our nights out are relatively tame<br>
                But back in our teens it was a rather different game<br>
                Primed with White Zinfandel we’d head to the Odyssey<br>
                Where we’d tear up the dance floor to Snoop D-O-double G</p>

                <p>One thing that hasn’t changed is that before we go to bed<br>
                We kick off our dancing shoes &amp; curl up with Father Ted<br>
                A mug of tea &amp; a slice of toast go well with egg in a cup<br>
                &amp; what do you know, we’re away to bed &amp; we’re half way sobered up.</p>

                <p>Sunday school excursions used to be an annual event,<br>
                Mars bar sandwiches on the way to Portrush, then off to Barry’s we went.<br>
                You see, she always did have a thing for Barrys, but back then we never knew,<br>
                That she would fall for a big ginger Armagh boy &amp; end up saying ‘I do’.</p>

                <p>Which brings us on to Mr McGee, who we both quite literally look up to,<br>
                He’s handsome, charming, intelligent &amp; even quite funny, if you’ve had a few.<br>
                Joking aside, it’s a thumbs up from us, we think you’re one in a million,<br>
                And, most importantly, you’re perfect for our wee Gillian.</p>

                <p>So thank you both for giving us this honour at your wedding,<br>
                Hopefully we haven’t brought up anything you were dreading.<br>
                Instead we’ve tried to illustrate just how many good times we’ve had,<br>
                &amp; look forward to all those ahead, when you’ll hopefully be ‘Mum &amp; Dad!’</p>

                <p>So to finish off we ask you all to stand &amp; raise a toast...<br>
                To Gillian &amp; Barry, the couple we love the most!</p>

                <p>😍</p>
